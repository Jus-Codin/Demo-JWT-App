# Demo JWT App

This is a simple demo app that uses JWT for authentication.
The frontend was built with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and the backend uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) and [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/).

## Running the App

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app with `flask run --host="0.0.0.0" --port=1337`

## Credentials
1. Username: `admin`, Password: `password`
2. Username: `user`, Password: `password`

## Potential Improvements
1. Create a static version of the website to allow for easier hosting. (This might be done on a seperate branch)
